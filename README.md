### Archived 📦
This was my first ever official "project" and in the current state of Spicetify (especially with a rust rewrite coming in the future) i do not have the time or passion to maintain this codespace anymore.

Not only have i not used python properly in around 2 years, but alot of what this installer aimed to solve has been implemented directly into Spicetifys install script and preprocessing logic.
